- The .ga instances except BigCityHQ are provided by me.

- BigCityHQ.ga is a multiple-copy-paste/not-so-accurate representation of a public domain graph.
  (You must extract the above instance using WinRar).

- TestMap**.at are the original long-formated tile instances found in Julien Lecomte's [CodeId=31654]

- LaVolpe.bmp is a "Screenshot" of LaVolpe's remarkable pathfinder [CodeId=50278]
  Obviously, running Dijkstra in the above instance will be very slow and resource-hungry.
  It can be used, however, for finding improved distance Lower Bounds.

- PSC.bmp is... well you'll find out!

> Direct image loading supported, at last! (And it is drawn as a graph! -albeit slowly-) ;)

> WARNING: MidRes+ images (>800x600) will need a lot of RAM. If you want to work with large images, convert all double values to single or longs (don't forget to change Infinity constants).
